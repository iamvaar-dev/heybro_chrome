# Heybro 🤖

**Don't change your browser, just ask Bro to do it.**

Heybro is a Chrome extension that automates your browser tasks using AI. Just tell it what you want in plain English, and watch it work.

## ✨ What does it do?

Instead of clicking buttons and filling forms yourself, you tell Heybro what to do:

- "Go to Amazon and search for wireless headphones"
- "Open Gmail and draft an email to John"
- "Find the cheapest flight to NYC on Google Flights"

Heybro understands your request, looks at the page, and does the task for you.
